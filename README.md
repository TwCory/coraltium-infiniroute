# Coraltium InfiniRoute
Project of mine to build a fully-FOSS routing platform based on Debian Linux currently, goal of being comparable to Cisco IOS and other closed platforms.

# My reasoning for doing this:
I have been extensively interested in topics relating to computer networking, Linux, security-related topics, etc. for a very long time by now. I never was as invested into programming and software for the longest time, mainly since a good portion of the material which I used for learning in relation to computer networking and such, didn't have much of anything relating to programming. Later on (actually just a few weeks ago), I had a thought along the lines of "You know, all I do is essentially look at standards, informative articles, documentation and such about this networking stuff, but I think I am severely behind everyone else in terms of skills and such.". Essentially, I was suddenly thinking of the developers who create and optimize all of these networking tools and such are probably the people who understand computer networking the best. I have known about certain free routing platforms, such as FRR, BIRD, VyOS Vyatta, and BSD-based firewalls like pfSense and OPNsense, but I really wanted to see something that provided functionality like that of big name companies like Cisco and Juniper, that could provide a rich set of functionality, and always be completely free. That is essentially where my inspiration for this entered, as I always wanted to pursue a big project to make something that would actually appeal to networking people in general, and not just strictly for my use.
